\chapter{Detailed Results}

If there is material that you want to include, but it does not fit into the thesis itself, it may belong into the appendix.
Something like a detailed description of a specific algorithm, a long table with results from an experiment, or an interesting discussion that does not fit into the main narrative of your work.

Appendices are structured like chapters, possibly including sections, subsections, tables, images etc.
