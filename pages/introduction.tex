The topic at hand is an important problem discussed several times in the recent literature~\cite{oakland23-xfl,spmag23-mlmalware,cryptosec11}. Industry requires a solution to this problem, as it is a major bottleneck in the development of new products~\cite{statemerging-patent}. As \citet{conformance-testing-arxiv} point out, it also is a major challenge in the field of conformance testing.

In particular, this thesis makes the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We define the problem of abc as an instance of xyz~(\autoref{chapter:content1}).
    \item We review the literature on xyz and show how corresponding solutions can be transferred to abc, following the example of def~(\autoref{chapter:content2}).
    \item We demonstrate how to encode a specific example of abc to WizWoz, an implementation of def~(\autoref{chapter:content3}), and confirm that it effectively solves the problem~(\autoref{chapter:evaluation}).
\end{itemize}
